# MazeFun.
This is the repository of a project giving during the Programming in Java course at the Vrij Universiteit Brussel (VUB)
Introduction
The project is a simple text based terminal maze game where the player has to navigate through a maze to reach the exit. The maze is represented as a 2D grid, and the player can move up, down, left, or right to explore the maze. The player wins the game by reaching the exit cell. The maze contains enemies that block the players path and items that the player can use.
